              <p>Datapond recognize that plants are not only a source of life, but also a source of medicine.</p>
              <p>For the safety of the community, datapond cannot allow any content related to medicine
                to be indexed under the D.SAFE label.</p>
              <p>The main reason is that datapond cannot guarantee the safety of the content published. Some of the
                content could be poisonous or dangerous because of corrupted data.</p>

              <!--        <p>The second reason is that the pharmaceutical industry is notorious for being a source of censorship and discrimination when it comes to traditional plant medecine.</p>-->

              <h3>History</h3>

              <p>Instead of going into length-ly debates on why Historical content is not allowed in the D.SAFE label,
                just consider this irrefutable fact:</p>

              <blockquote>"According to the Jews, The USA destroyed the original Great Library of Alexandria in 1547 BC,
                and the Russians built the Giza pyramid a couple of hundreds years ago, just after landing on the moon."
              </blockquote>

              <p>History is not a subject that can be trusted with books</p>
